# An Exploration of Social Determinants of Health in U.S. Cities
### Background
The United States spends more money on healthcare services than any other country in the world. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study in 2016 that compared the United States with the 10 highest-income countries in the world. In fact,
- the U.S. spends nearly 18% of its GDP on healthcare services while the next highest country, Switzerland, spends about 12.4%;
- our administrative costs are also very high at 8% compared to those other countries, where they range between 1-3%;
- and per capita, we spend between $1,400-$1,500 on pharmaceutical drugs, while the other countries range between $466-$939.

Considering how much the U.S. spends on healthcare services each year, one would be inclined to believe that U.S. citizens must have the best health outcomes. However, according to that same study from JAMA, that is not the case.
- 70.1% are either overweight or obese in the U.S., while mean of all 11 countries is about 55.6%.
- Life expectancy is the lowest in the U.S. at 78.6 years and has been declining over time.
- Infant mortality is the highest in the U.S. at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the mean of all 11 countries is about 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births.

So, why are health outcomes in the U.S. so poor compared to other high-income countries even though we tend to spend a lot on healthcare services? I strongly believe this comes down to a couple factors:
- We focus a lot of our attention on specialization in this country. Medical students and residents often want to specialize in a particular area of medicine since there are a lot of accolades that come with specialization. Also, the majority of research that is conducted focuses on very specific areas of medicine. Therefore, not a lot of attention gets placed on primary care or preventive medicine, which could significantly help decrease the prevalence of several chronic conditions.
- Hospitals and physicians have never been financially incentivized to give proper care to the patients they serve. The traditional fee-for-service model has always been about the quantity of procedures done, not the quality of care provided. This trend, however, has started to shift towards a value-based model, in which providers are now responsible for how well patients do after the visit.

### Purpose of the App
How can we expect our physicians do know how well we do after we are seen in the hospital? Or, maybe more importantly, how are our physicians supposed to know of our conditions before we even enter the hospital? I believe the answer lies in closely tracking and measuring Social Determinants of Health.

The World Health Organization has defined **Social Determinants of Health** as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age." This definition has expanded over time, so that now we can categorize Social Determinants into one of three main buckets:
- Health Behaviors (do you smoke? are you physically active?)
- Socioeconomic Factors (do you have a high school degree? are you employed?)
- Physical Environment (do you live around a lot of crime? do you live close to a healthcare provider?)

My application, the Social Determinants of Health Explorer, allows health policy analysts and medical researchers a way to explore the relationship between Social Determinants and health outcomes across the 500 most populated cities in the United States. Findings from this application could potentially lead to designing public health programs to better serve populations.
